Hey!
In this project, I recreated a website to showcase and "sell" the car of my dreams. It's a creative project that showcases my passion for cars and my desire to improve my front-end development skills.

## 💡 About the Project 💡 ##
This is a fully responsive static website, built with HTML5 and CSS3. It was created as part of a course project to apply various modern front-end development techniques.
The site includes:
- Home page with images, highlights and specifications
- Customization page to "buy" your car
- About page
- ContactUs and FAQ page
- 404 error page
- Car photo gallery page
All pages are designed to be clean, accessible and responsive on all devices.

## 🎯 Purpose 🎯 ##
This project was useful in challenging my front-end skills by working through and implementing key development practices including advanced CSS selectors, responsive design, animations, semantic HTML, and proper use of Git version control.
It also served as a basis for creating visuals and screenshots to be included in a companion presentation, as outlined in the provided slides.
