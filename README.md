🚗 Dream Car Website 🚗 

Hey!
In this project, I recreated a website to showcase and "sell" the car of my dreams. It's a creative project that showcases my passion for cars and my desire to improve my front-end development skills.

💡 About the Project 💡

This is a static website created with just HTML and CSS. The goal was to create a clean and visually appealing layout that resembled a car sales page. It includes:
A home page with a main section, car highlights, and some specifications
A page to choose colors and looks for your car
And an About page

🎯 Purpose 🎯

Practice and improve my skills with HTML and CSS, keeping in mind that the company I will work for may ask for a page based on that photo and I will need to recreate it.

🛠️ Technologies Used 🛠️

HTML5
CSS3
